# Store Implementation Strategy

## Overview

Based on the provided design, we need to implement a store page that displays researcher profiles with their skills, training hours, accuracy, and tools. The store will have two main tabs: Agents and Business.

## Components Required

1. **Store Page Layout**
   - Header with tabs (Agents/Business)
   - Search bar with category filter
   - Grid layout for researcher cards

2. **Researcher Card Component**
   - Already exists in `/src/components/store/researcher-card.tsx`
   - Displays researcher profile with:
     - Avatar and name
     - Role (Researcher)
     - Core skill
     - Tool icons
     - Training hours
     - Accuracy percentage
     - Add button

3. **Store State Management**
   - Create a new Zustand store: `marketplace-store.ts`
   - Manage researchers data
   - Implement cart functionality
   - Handle filtering and search

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create the Marketplace Store

Create a new Zustand store at `/src/stores/marketplace-store.ts` with the following features:
- Define Researcher interface
- Store researchers data
- Cart management (add/remove researchers)
- Filter functionality (by category, search term)

### 2. Update the Store Page

Update the existing page at `/src/app/(workspace)/store/page.tsx` to:
- Implement the tabbed interface (Agents/Business)
- Add search and filter functionality
- Display researcher cards in a responsive grid

### 3. Styling and Responsiveness

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure the layout is responsive for different screen sizes
- Match the dark theme from the design

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface Researcher {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  avatar: string;
  coreSkill: string;
  tools: string[];
  trainingHours: number;
  accuracy: number;
}
```

## Mock Data

Based on the design, we'll create mock data for the following researchers:
1. Becca - TikTok Trend Analysis
2. Marcus - Investment Analysis
3. Sophia - Project Coordination
4. Aiden - Data Storytelling
5. Elena - Creative Writing
6. Jamal - SEO Strategy

## Next Steps

1. Implement the marketplace store
2. Update the store page layout
3. Test the functionality
4. Ensure responsive design
